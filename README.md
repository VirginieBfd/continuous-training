# Continuous Training

This repository serves as a foundation for setting up a continuous training pipeline using MLOps tools such as 
Docker, Wandb, and Github Actions. 

With this infrastructure in place, you can efficiently train and iterate on your machine learning models while 
ensuring reproducibility and scalability.
